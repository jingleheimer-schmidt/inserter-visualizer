# Overview

This mod also adds a quickbar shortcut and associated hotkey (default: ctrl/cmd + i) to toggle live selection highlighting.

# Compatibility
To report a compatibility issue, please make a post on the discussion page.
This mod has been designed and tested specifically for base game inserters, and compatibility with mods that allow arbitrarily changing drop positions is not guaranteed.
This mod cannot detect when another mod changes the drop position of an inserter unless that mod raises an event.
